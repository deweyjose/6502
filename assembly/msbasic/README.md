# Microsoft BASIC for 6502 - Credits and Attribution

## üéØ Original Source

This Microsoft BASIC implementation is based on the excellent work by **Michael Steil** and contributors at [mist64/msbasic](https://github.com/mist64/msbasic).

## üìö What is mist64/msbasic?

The [mist64/msbasic](https://github.com/mist64/msbasic) repository is a remarkable piece of reverse engineering and historical preservation. It's a **single integrated assembly source tree** that can generate nine different versions of Microsoft BASIC for 6502, including:

- **Commodore BASIC 1 & 2** (1977-1979)
- **AppleSoft I & II** (1977-1978) 
- **OSI BASIC** (1977)
- **KIM-1 BASIC** (1977)
- **AIM-65 BASIC** (1978)
- **SYM-1 BASIC** (1978)
- **KBD BASIC** (1982)
- **MicroTAN BASIC** (1980)

## üèÜ Why This Matters

This project represents an incredible achievement in computer history preservation:

- **Historical Accuracy**: Faithful recreation of 1970s Microsoft BASIC implementations
- **Educational Value**: Perfect for understanding how early microcomputer software worked
- **Cross-Platform**: Single source code that generates multiple historical versions
- **Reverse Engineering**: Meticulous work to recreate the original Microsoft source code

## üîß How We Use It

Our breadboard 6502 computer uses the **Eater configuration** from mist64/msbasic, which includes:

- **Platform Detection**: Automatically selects Eater-specific settings
- **Memory Configuration**: Proper segment layout for our hardware
- **BIOS Integration**: Seamless integration with our custom BIOS
- **Wozmon Integration**: Works alongside our monitor program
