## üéØ What It Does

This project brings **professional-grade serial communication** to your breadboard 6502 using the W65C51S ACIA (Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter)! You can now:

- **Receive characters** from any RS-232 terminal or PC
- **Echo characters back** with proper terminal compatibility
- **Handle special keys** like backspace with correct terminal behavior
- **Use hardware flow control** for reliable data transmission
- **Debug in real-time** with bidirectional character echo
- **Connect to any serial device** with industry-standard RS-232

All powered by a dedicated UART chip handling the complex protocol details!

## üîß How It Works

### The W65C51S ACIA Magic

The W65C51S ACIA is a dedicated UART chip that handles all the RS-232 protocol complexity:

```assembly
; Initialize the ACIA
lda #$00
sta ACIA_STATUS     ; Soft reset the ACIA

lda #$1f            ; 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, 19200 baud
sta ACIA_CTRL

lda #$0b            ; No parity, no echo, no interrupt
sta ACIA_CMD
```

### Hardware Flow Control

The ACIA provides built-in status checking for reliable communication:

```assembly
rx_wait:
  lda ACIA_STATUS
  and #$08          ; Check if data is available (bit 3)
  beq rx_wait       ; Wait until data arrives

  lda ACIA_DATA     ; Read the character
  jsr lcd_print_char ; Display on LCD
  jsr send_char     ; Echo back to terminal
  jmp rx_wait
```

### Transmission with Flow Control

The `send_char` function uses hardware flow control to ensure reliable transmission:

```assembly
send_char:
  sta ACIA_DATA     ; Put character in transmit buffer
  pha
tx_wait:
  lda ACIA_STATUS
  and #$10          ; Check if transmitter is ready (bit 4)
  beq tx_wait       ; Wait until ready
  jsr tx_delay      ; Small delay for reliability
  pla
  rts
```

### Special Key Handling

The system provides proper terminal behavior for special keys:

```assembly
cmp #$7F            ; Check for DEL character
beq del_key

del_key:
  pha
  lda #$08          ; Send backspace to terminal
  jsr send_char
  lda #' '          ; Send space to overwrite
  jsr send_char
  lda #$08          ; Send backspace again
  jsr send_char
  pla
  jsr lcd_backspace ; Handle LCD side
  jmp rx_wait
```

## üé® The Hardware Setup

### ACIA Configuration

The W65C51S ACIA handles all RS-232 protocol details:

- **Baud Rate**: 19,200 (configurable via ACIA_CTRL)
- **Data Format**: 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
- **Flow Control**: Hardware status checking
- **Voltage Levels**: TTL (0V/5V) - requires MAX232 for RS-232 conversion

### MAX232 Level Shifting

Since RS-232 uses ¬±12V levels and our 6502 uses 5V TTL, we need a MAX232 chip:

```
PC Terminal ‚Üê‚Üí MAX232 ‚Üê‚Üí W65C51S ACIA ‚Üê‚Üí 6502
   ¬±12V         TTL         TTL          5V
```

### Pin Connections

The ACIA connects to the 6502 through address decoding:

```
ACIA Pin 13 (RXD) ‚Üê‚Üí VIA Output (receives data from terminal)
ACIA Pin 14 (TXD) ‚Üê‚Üí VIA Input  (sends data to terminal)
ACIA Pin 10 (CTS) ‚Üê‚Üí MAX232     (flow control)
ACIA Pin 12 (DCD) ‚Üê‚Üí MAX232     (data carrier detect)
```

## üêõ The Hardware Bug Adventure

### The Mystery: Why Won't It Work?

Getting the UART working perfectly was a **real adventure**! We encountered several mysterious issues:

1. **Characters appearing garbled** on the LCD
2. **Transmission working but reception failing**
3. **Intermittent communication** that would work sometimes
4. **LCD display corruption** during serial communication

### The Debugging Journey

We went through extensive debugging to isolate the problems:

#### 1. Software Debugging
```assembly
; Added binary display to see what we were actually receiving
print_byte_binary:
  pha              ; save original A
  ldy #8           ; 8 bits to process
  sta temp         ; stash working copy in zero page
  ; ... binary display code ...
```

#### 2. LCD Library Bug Fixes
We discovered and fixed several bugs in our LCD library:

**Problem**: The `lcd_print_char` function was corrupting the A register:
```assembly
; BUGGY VERSION - A gets corrupted by ora instructions
lcd_print_char:
  pha
  jsr lcd_wait
  pla
  pha
  lsr
  lsr
  lsr
  lsr             ; Send high 4 bits
  ora #RS         ; A is now modified!
  sta PORTB
  ; ... more ora operations that corrupt A ...
  pla             ; This doesn't restore the original A!
  rts
```

**Solution**: Proper register preservation:
```assembly
; FIXED VERSION - A is properly preserved
lcd_print_char:
  pha             ; Save original A
  jsr lcd_wait
  pla             ; Get original back
  pha             ; Save it again
  lsr
  lsr
  lsr
  lsr             ; Send high 4 bits
  ora #RS         ; A is modified, but we have original on stack
  sta PORTB
  ; ... process high nibble ...
  pla             ; Get original character back
  pha             ; Save it again for after the function
  and #%00001111  ; Send low 4 bits
  ora #RS         ; A is modified again
  sta PORTB
  ; ... process low nibble ...
  pla             ; Restore original A
  rts
```

#### 3. The Hardware Culprit: Wrong Capacitor!

After extensive software debugging, we discovered the **real problem**:

**The Issue**: The kit included a **50nF capacitor** when it should have been a **30pF capacitor**!

**Why This Matters**:
- The capacitor is used in the MAX232's internal oscillator circuit
- Wrong capacitance = wrong oscillator frequency
- Wrong frequency = incorrect baud rate generation
- Incorrect baud rate = garbled communication

**The Fix**: Replace the 50nF capacitor with the correct 30pF capacitor.

### The Learning Experience

This debugging adventure taught us valuable lessons:

1. **Hardware issues can masquerade as software bugs**
2. **Always verify component values** match the schematic
3. **Systematic debugging** is essential for complex systems
4. **Library functions must be well-behaved** (preserve registers)
5. **Sometimes the problem is in the parts bin, not the code!**

## üéØ Debugging Tips

Based on our debugging adventure:

1. **Check component values** first - wrong parts cause mysterious bugs
2. **Verify library functions** preserve registers properly
3. **Use binary display** to see what you're actually receiving
4. **Test with known data** patterns
5. **Check baud rate** with oscilloscope if possible
6. **Verify connections** with multimeter

## üîÑ Comparison: Bit-Banging vs UART

| Feature | Bit-Banging | UART (ACIA) |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Hardware** | VIA GPIO only | Dedicated UART chip |
| **Software** | Complex timing | Simple register access |
| **Reliability** | Timing dependent | Hardware guaranteed |
| **Baud Rate** | Fixed by software | Configurable |
| **Learning Value** | Protocol understanding | Hardware integration |
| **Real-world Use** | Educational | Professional |

Both approaches have their place, but the UART approach is more practical for real applications!
